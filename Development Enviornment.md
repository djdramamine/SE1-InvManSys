## Development Enviornment
Hey guys, I just wanted to update.  The server has been setup with a LEMP stack.   

We talked breifly about PHP during our first meeting so I've installed it on the server. If we want to use something different that's fine I just wanted to make something available to play around with for now.   

I'll play around with groups and permissions so you can all edit the ***var/www/html/ directory*** (This is where the webserver is pointed) once you've changed your default passwords   

I created an initial database over the weekend that sort of mimics the design of the Inventory and Sales portions of the database of SAGE 100 which is a professional IMS I've worked closely with in the past with a few things I've added myself. This of course can be reviewed and changed if need be, but I think it's a good bseline to start with for the next few sprints.
