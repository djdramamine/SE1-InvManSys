//Scrum Schedual
//Waiting on team to decide ideal meeting times either online or in person.

Daniel's Schedule-   
      Monday-Friday
            Generally anytime after 4,5 or 6 (could be earlier if needed but dicey)
            I can do remote meetings pretty much anytime as long as I'm not in a meeting while at work.
            If meetings are going to be in person... I'll try to accomodate as much as I can, but recommend we do it before/after class 
      Saturday,Sunday
            Anytime as long as it isn't too late on Sunday
