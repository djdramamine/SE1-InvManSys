## Scrum Topics and Roles w/ Details
### Scrum Overview
* Scrum is bsed on an iterative approach to the software development lifecyle
* In Scrum, the project is broken up into development units called sprints
* At the end of each sprint, the customer sees a demonstration of the current product increment and gives feedback and a team retrospective is held
* Each team member should be assigned full time to the team
* The Scrum team is self-organizing, with no team leader
* The whole team is accountable, so it commits to the work as a whole   
## Scrum Values
**Openness**   - This value comes with the team's ability to self-organize   
**Focus**      - Teams focus on the same well-defined goals, which leads to high qquality work that delivers value quickly   
**Courage**    - As the team gains trust in their ability to accomplish goals together, they take on more work and greater challenges   
**Commitment** - The team determines the amount of work it can accomplish in the next sprint, and pledges to get it done   
**Respect**    - This value comes with the team's ability to self-organize

#### High Quality User Stories
* The team are able to estimate and complete a good user story very quickly
* A good user story is focused and easy to understand
* The story is completed early allowing QA to test it during the sprint
* Stories should be sized appropriately at the top of the product backlog

#### Burndown Chart
* At a glance, the initial amount of work taken in the sprint planning meeting
* The estimated amount of work that's still remaining to complete during the sprint
* The velocity of a sprint
---
#### Product Backlog
* The product backlog items do not say *how* the team should fulfil the item
* The product backlog represents requirements, so every one of these items is saying what needs to be done
* User stories are refined and split into smaller user stories during the backlog grooming meeting
* Contains things like:
  * Epics describing an entire functional area
  * A user story describing a feature
  * Risks or ideas
  * A defect or SPIKE
---
#### Sprint Backlog
* The team selectes the highest-priority items from the product backlog and moves them to the sprint backlog at the sprint backlog meeting
* When the sprint backlog is at capacity, it's frozen
* The sprint backlog is updated each day by the Scrum master after the Scrum meeting

* Interacts with the other stakeholders to create a list of features held in the product backlog
* Owns the product backlog and must assign a priority to each product backlog item
* Holds the vision of the final product, and is the key stakeholder, making decisions to chaieve a good return on investment on the project
* Determines what features are included in each sprint.   
   
Some important points:   
* Through discussions and their own knowledge, the product owner forms a vision of the final product and conveys this to the team
* The product owner decides when the product increment should be released
* They have no authority to determine the number of items worked in the sprint of the time it will take to complete each task
* They cannot define how the team creates or works the task to complete development of each item
* They can only dictate what is worked in the next sprint
